Description: Likelihood-based approaches to estimate linear regression parameters and treatment effects in the presence of endogeneity. Specifically, this package includes James Heckman's classical simultaneous equation models-the sample selection model for outcome selection bias and hybrid model with structural shift for endogenous treatment. For more information, see the seminal paper of Heckman (1978) <DOI:10.3386/w0177> in which the details of these models are provided. This package accommodates repeated measures on subjects with a working independence approach. The hybrid model further accommodates treatment effect modification.
